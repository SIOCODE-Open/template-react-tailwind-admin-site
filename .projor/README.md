# ProJor React + Tailwind Admin Site Template

This is a [ProJor](https://projor.io) template, that generates an _admin frontend site_, that uses _React_ and _Tailwind_. The application consists of _pages_, all of which are _generated by ProJor_.

## Using

* You should first install [ProJor](https://projor.io) to get started with this template.
* You also need to have [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. Alternatively, you can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to build & run the generated application.
* Open up the [`.pages`](.pages) file, and start adding your own pages:

```
// The admin dashboard page
dashboard Dashboard[ic:baseline-dashboard] {
    title Admin dashboard
    message This is the admin dashboard. It is left empty for this example.
}
// The list of products page
list-page Products[ic:baseline-shopping_cart] {
    title Products
    message This is the list of products. You can edit or delete them.
    column id: number example 465191de-2108-4dc0-ac81-d3d53f2176e1
    column name: string example Vacuum Cleaner
    column description: string example This device will suck the dust from the floor to make it cleaner.
    column buys_last_week: number example 57
    column price: number example $99.99
    item action Edit[ic:baseline-edit] goes to EditProduct
    item action Delete[ic:baseline-delete] goes to Products
}
// The edit product page
edit-page EditProduct[ic:baseline-edit] {
    title Edit Vacuum Cleaner
    message You are editing product 465191de-2108-4dc0-ac81-d3d53f2176e1 called Vacuum Cleaner.
    field name: string example Vacuum Cleaner
    field description: string example This device will suck the dust from the floor to make it cleaner.
    field price: number example $99.99
    item action Save[ic:baseline-save] goes to Products
    item action Cancel[ic:baseline-cancel] goes to Products
    item action Delete[ic:baseline-delete] goes to Products
}
```

* Now, you can run `projor generate`, and it will generate the source code.
* Run `npm install`, then `npm run serve` and open up your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to see the generated site.

## Further customization

There are multiple files in [`.projor/`](./) to customize the generated site:

* The [`project.pglobal.yaml`](project.pglobal.yaml) file contains settings like _npm package scope_, and _version_.
* The [`header.pglobal.yaml`](header.pglobal.yaml) file contains settings for the _site header_. Customize options like _background color_, or _disable the header completely_ in this file.
* The [`sidebar.pglobal.yaml`](sidebar.pglobal.yaml) file contains settings for the _site sidebar_. Customize options like _background color_, or _disable the sidebar completely_ in this file.
* The [`footer.pglobal.yaml`](footer.pglobal.yaml) file contains settings for the _site footer_. Customize options like _background color_, or _disable the footer completely_ in this file.
* The [`actions.pglobal.yaml`](actions.pglobal.yaml) file contains settings for any generated _action buttons_.
